1. Finding Peak For 1D Array [Time Complexity : O(Log n)]
Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it. An array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor.

2. Find Local Minima For 1D Array [Time Complexity : O(Log n)]
An element arr[x] is a local minimum if it is less than or equal to both its neighbors.
